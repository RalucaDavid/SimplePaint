# SimplePaint
SimplePaint is my project for my high school computer science certificate ( atestat ) and it was done in May, 2022. I used Visual studio code as source editor.
It has the names of the functions and comments in Romanian and problems with certain small resolutions because everything is fixed on a certain position.
I will make a better and updated version in the future.
